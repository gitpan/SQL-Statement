Version 1.003, released 01 March, 2002

   aliases) are now all case insensitive as required by the SQL
   standard. all older versions including the XS versions used
   case sensitive column names

 * improved and/or fixed bugs in:

   * placeholder support
     Thanks Achim Grolms <Achim.Grolms@fujitsu-siemens.com>

   * table name aliases in explicit joins

----------------------------------------

 * added backwards compatiblity: both SQL::Statement and
   SQL::Parser now work in perl version 5.004 and above.

 * changed defaults for DBD::CSV so it now accepts new SQL
   without adding extra flags to scripts

 * added support for SQL comments

 * added support for temporary tables and on commit clauses in
   CREATE statements and drop behaviour flags in DROP statements
   (SQL::Parser only, not supported by SQL::Statement)

 * fixed bugs in qualified column names (e.g. tableA.*), and in
   joins using ON or WHERE

Version 1.001, released January 17,2002
---------------------------------------

Fixed bug in UPDATE that caused the new value to be a hash
rather than a scalar.

Version 1.0, released January 15, 2002
--------------------------------------

This is the first CPAN release of the pure perl version of the
module.  It was previously released in an XS version by Jochen
Wiedman who has turned over maintenance of it to me.

The new Pure Perl version of SQL::Statement supports everything
supported by the XS version and, additionally, at least partial
support for the following features that are not supported at all
by the XS version:

 * Explicit and implicit joins
 * Table name aliases
 * Set functions
 * String functions
 * String concatenation
 * Numeric expressions
 * IN predicate
 * BETWEEN predicate
 * Alphabetic comparison in WHERE clauses
 * Ordering of text that looks like a number
 * Verbose error messages for both Parsing and Execution errors
