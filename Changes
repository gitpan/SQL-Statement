Changes log for Perl extension SQL::Statement

Version 1.0, released January 15, 2002
--------------------------------------

This is the first CPAN release of the pure perl version of the module.  It was previously released in an XS version by Jochen Wiedman who has turned over maintenance of it to me.

The new Pure Perl version of SQL::Statement supports everything supported by the XS version and, additionally, at least partial support for the following features that are not supported at all by the XS version:

 * Explicit and implicit joins
 * Table name aliases
 * Set functions
 * String functions
 * String concatenation
 * Numeric expressions
 * IN predicate
 * BETWEEN predicate
 * Alphabetic comparison in WHERE clauses
 * Ordering of text that looks like a number
 * Verbose error messages for both Parsing and Execution errors
